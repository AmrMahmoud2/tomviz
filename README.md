The [tomviz project][tomviz] is developing a cross platform, open source
application for the processing, visualization, and analysis of 3D tomography
data. It is currently at an early stage of development, but is already capable
of displaying, visualizing, and interacting with 3D reconstructions of
tomographic data. In addition basic alignment and tomographic reconstruction
are available, with Python scripts that can be modified in the interface to
experiment with different techniques.
