tomviz

Introduction
------------

The tomviz project is developing a cross platform, open source application for
the processing, visualization, and analysis of 3D tomography data. It is
currently at an early stage of development, but is already capable of
displaying, visualizing, and interacting with 3D reconstructions of tomographic
data. In addition basic alignment and tomographic reconstruction are available,
with Python scripts that can be modified in the interface to experiment with
different techniques.
